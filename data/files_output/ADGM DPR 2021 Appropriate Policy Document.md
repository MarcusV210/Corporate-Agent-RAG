INTRODUCTION TO THIS GUIDANCE
Introduction to Abu Dhabi Global Market
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is a broad based international financial centre, established pursuant
to Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. With its own civil and commercial laws
based on the English common law, ADGM offers the local, regional and international business
community a world-class legal system and regulatory regime.
About this guidance
This guidance is prepared to support Controllers and Processors in complying with the applicable
provisions in the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 (DPR 2021) regarding the processing of
specific categories of sensitive data, also referred to as ‘special categories of data.’ The DPR 2021
requires ADGM Licensed Persons to establish a separate policy document known as an ‘Appropriate
Policy Document’ (“APD”) in cases where a Controller processes certain special categories of
personal data.
Who the guidance is aimed at
This guidance applies to ADGM Licensed Persons who collects and processes special category of
personal data and has day-to-day responsibility for personal data. It is aimed at small and medium
enterprises although it may also be useful for larger organisations and their legal advisors.
Further details are available in relation to the ADGM DPR 2021 requirements in Part 1 of this
Guidance.
What the guidance does
This guidance aims to explain what the APD is and how it may apply to your processing activities.
This guidance includes a template to help you ask the right questions, and understand your obligation.
However, the ultimate responsibility of how to do and how to justify decisions remains with the firm.
This is a key principle of the DPR 2021, known as the accountability principle.
What are special categories of personal data?
Certain types of personal data, known as special categories or personal data, receive additional
protection under the DPR 2021 because they are more sensitive. The DPR 2021 defines the following
as special categories of personal data:




personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;

personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures.

basis for processing see Part 1 of the DPR 2021 Guidance.

THE REQUIREMENT
What does the law say?
Article 7(3) of the DPR 2021 states that:
Where it is specified that a condition in section 7(2) is met only if the Controller has an
appropriate policy document in place, the Controller will have an appropriate policy
document in place if: (a) the policy document (which may incorporate other documents by
reference) explains, for Personal Data Processed in reliance on the condition:
(i) how the Controller will comply with the principles in section 4; and
(ii) the Controller’s policies regarding the retention and erasure of that Personal Data; and
(b) from the date the Controller starts to Process Personal Data in reliance on the
condition until 6 months after the Controller ceases to carry out such Processing,
the policy document referred to in section 7(3)(a) is:
(i) retained, reviewed and updated (as appropriate); and
(ii) made available to the Commissioner of Data Protection on request.
What specified conditions require an APD?
Section 7(2) of the DPR 2021 sets out the conditions that require Controllers to have an APD in
place.
An APD is required where the processing of special category is:
 Necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the
Controller
or
of
the
Data
Subject
in
the
field
of
employment
law.
 Necessary

for

reasons

of

substantial

public

interest

in:

 (i) the exercise of a function or requirement conferred on a person by Applicable Law;
 (ii) the exercise of a function of the Board, Abu Dhabi or United Arab Emirate government;
 (iii) the administration of justice;
 (iv) equality of opportunity or treatment provided that the Processing does not, or is not
likely to, cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual; and it does not
relate to an individual who has given written notice to the Controller not to Process their

Appropriate Policy Document

Personal

Data;

 (v) diversity at senior levels of organisations, where the Controller cannot reasonably be
expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject and is not aware of the Data Subject
withholding Consent provided that the Processing does not, or is not likely to, cause
substantial
damage
or
substantial
distress
to
an
individual;
 (vi) the prevention or detection of an unlawful act or omission where the Processing must
be carried out without the Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose;
and if the Processing relates to the disclosure of Personal Data to a relevant public
authority;
 (vii) the protection of the members of the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other
seriously improper conduct, unfitness or incompetence, mismanagement in the
administration of a company, body or association, or failures in services provided by a
company, body or association where the Processing must be carried out without the
Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose;
 (viii) compliance with, or assisting other persons to comply with, a regulatory requirement
which involves a person taking steps to establish whether another person has committed
an unlawful act or omission, or been involved in dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously
improper conduct where the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the
Consent
of
the
Data
Subject
to
the
Processing;
 (ix) the prevention of fraud in connection with Processing of Personal Data as a member
of, or in accordance with arrangements made by, an antifraud organisation;
 (x) the disclosure in good faith to an appropriate public authority regarding suspected
terrorist financing, to identify terrorist property or in relation to suspected money
laundering,
in
accordance
with
Applicable
Law;
 (xi) the publication of a judgment or other decision of a court or tribunal or if the Processing
is necessary for the purposes of publishing such a judgment or decision.
What about the other conditions?
An APD is not required in all instances where there is processing of special category of personal
data. Where the condition does not specify a need for an APD, you do not need one. You may still
choose to develop one for your own governance and record-keeping.
How does this differ from the mandatory Record of Processing Activity (RoPA)?
The ADP complements the mandatory register of processing activity. The record of processing
encompasses and captures all processing activities within your organisation. The RoPA activity would
be useful in identifying those special category data covered by the above requirement for an APD.
The APD is a standalone policy that is required for demonstrating accountability. The APD must be
made available to data subjects and the Office of Data Protection.
